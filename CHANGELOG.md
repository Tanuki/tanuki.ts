# Changelog

[5/2] Support for Together AI and Bedrock models. Parity with the [Python release](https://github.com/Tanuki/tanuki.py).

[25/1] Initial Typescript Release in line with the [Python release](https://github.com/Tanuki/tanuki.py).

[27/11] Renamed MonkeyPatch to Tanuki, support for [embeddings](https://github.com/monkeypatch/tanuki.py/blob/update_docs/docs/embeddings_support.md) and [function configurability](https://github.com/monkeypatch/tanuki.py/blob/update_docs/docs/function_configurability.md) is released!
* Use embeddings to integrate Tanuki with downstream RAG implementations using OpenAI Ada-2 model.
*  Function configurability allows to configure Tanuki function executions to ignore certain implemented aspects (finetuning, data-storage communications) for improved latency and serverless integrations.
